# Creator
This project was **not** my idea, and as you can see in [this file](./frontend/README.md), I did not make the frontend either.
However, what **is** purely my code is the entire backend (the `src` folder).
I've written this backend for SeshCord, which, once again, was created initially by [mine-man3000](https://github.com/mine-man3000)
